            <description>Cornell University | Ithaca, NY 2020.02 - 2020.05 •	Constructed portfolios that replicated the behavior of S&amp;amp;G500 within the Markowitz framework.
•	Improved objective function with regularization terms to encourage sparsity and efficiently tracks an index.
•	Enhancing the model by introducing transaction costs to select more liquid securities.</description>

            <description>University of British Columbia | Vancouver, BC 2020.12 •	Cleaned, merged, and processed 100,000+ complex raw data sets, facilitating analysis and pattern recognition.
•	Used Python to develop a linear autoregressive model to predict future Covid-19 statistics, ranked within the top 20% in the competition.
•	Utilized cross-validation to tune hyperparameters and improve accuracy, decreased errors by 30%+.</description>
